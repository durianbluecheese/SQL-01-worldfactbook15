## SQL - CIA World Factbook(2015)

Project Description: The World Factbook, also known as CIA World Factbook, provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities. In this project, I worked with a table extracted from the Factbook database(2015). The table mainly contains the population and area information of countries.
